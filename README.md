In this demo students will learn the basics of using Github repositories for version control. They will learn to fork, clone, commit, and push. They will also get practice collaborating on repositories, including best practices for working simultaneously and resolving conflicts. Data for this activity comes from [OpenDataPhilly.](https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5dc1aeb93741fa001504b10b/representationdetails/5dc1aeb93741fa001504b10f/)



### Part 1: Using Github repositories
1. **Fork** this repo
2. **Clone** it to your laptop in Github desktop by pasting the repo URL
3. Edit the markdown, slightly changing the code for the map. Save once you're satisfied.
4. Go to Github Desktop to **commit** and **push** your changes.
5. Go to github.com to see your changes reflected.

### Part 2: Collaborating and resolving conflicts
1. In pairs, choose one person whose repo you will be using. Person A should invite the Person B to collaborate on their repo in settings.
2. Person B clones Person A's repo to their laptop.
3. Person A edits the map, then saves, commits, and pushes.
4.  *THIS IS IMPORTANT:* Without **pulling origin,** Person B edits the same map, then saves, commits, and pushes.
5.  At this point, you should have your first **conflict**! Work together to resolve it safely and ask your peers, TA, and Professor if you need help. Good luck!
